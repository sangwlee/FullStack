  **Objective:** With the MVP's completed (live chat, channel, direct message, multiple-person DM), the object of phase 7 is to set up the main page. During this page,
  much time will be spent to accomplish satisfactory styling. In addition, flawless navigation through frontpage and mainpage should be attained.

  ### Phase 8: STYLING & FINAL TOUCH (1 day)

  **Objective:** In this last phase, much of essential functionalities of application will have been implemented, tested, and styled. During this time, minor features, such as creating a channel, switching right column (between details and replies) will be attempted for implementation.
